### About

I've been a director of photography for 5 years. But I've always been interested in web design and technology and I like to do things by hand, that's why I want to learn frontend development in RS School. I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a Frontend Developer.

As Steve Jobs said in his [interview](https://stevejobsarchive.com/smithsonian-oral-history-interview):

> “There’s really very little distinction between an artist and as scientist or engineer of the highest caliber. They are people that “pursue different paths” but headed to the same goal.”
